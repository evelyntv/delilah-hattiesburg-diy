            <p class="article-content">
                I hate that I'm still writing love poems <br>
                with metaphors for fire but I'd burn holes down to my bones <br>
                in the exact shape of your hands if you said you wanted <br>
                to touch me somewhere no one else had <br><br>

                I told myself I would stop writing these <br>
                when I said goodbye to the fallen Angel <br>
                who burned when he touched something holy <br>
                but I can't help but associate love with burn scars <br>
                because you never unlearn your first; semantic networks <br>
                are not easily rewired - trust me I would know <br><br>

                I'm getting a Leana Firestone tattoo because I want <br>
                a Foreverever reminder of the teenage girl <br>
                I'll apparently never stop being - I can't forget <br>
                the girl who was so scared of being forgotten that she remembered <br>
                the birthday of the boy who told her their expiration date <br><br>

                She deserves better than that and I learned the hard way <br>
                sometimes the only person who will give you what you deserve <br>
                is you <br><br>

                So I'll hold her memory in my mind and the ink <br>
                on my pages and etched into the skin of my arm <br>
                and she'll know what it feels like to be remembered <br>
                while I learn what it feels like to be loved - I'll do it <br>
                whether you're here or not so the question isn't <br><br>

                "Do you love me?" <br>
                it's <br>
                "Will you stay while I learn to?" <br><br>
