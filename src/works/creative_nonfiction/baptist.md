This is how to cook Sunday dinner. You’ll have to be up by seven because you’ve got to leave for church by 9:30. Sunday school starts at 10, so you have to be there by 9:45. 

Make sure the house is clean before you start cooking, because you’ll have to clean the kitchen twice so you won’t have time to clean anywhere else. When you get in the kitchen, you’ve got to put your meat on first. The longer it takes, the earlier you have to get up. For a pot roast, seven is fine, but if you’re doing a ham you’ll need to start it by six. Make sure you have the oven high enough that it’ll get cooked before you get home, but low enough so the house don’t burn down. Don’t start the sides until right before you leave.

When you’re getting everything ready, start dessert right after you put the meat in, even if it seems backwards. The cake will have to go in as soon as you get back from church, because if you leave it in while you’re gone you’ll burn the hell out of it and nobody wants a holy cake. Once you’ve got the batter ready, put it in the fridge and start on your sides. You’ve got to have at least two vegetables, cast iron cornbread, and a box of macaroni never hurt nobody, but be sure to put the butter and milk in it like I showed you. Now, come on and I’ll show you how to set the table.

*But what if I don’t have anyone to invite to Sunday dinner?* 

When you set the table, you always put your guest next to you. If they’re down there at the other end of the table next to people they don’t know, they’ll get all uncomfortable, and you can’t ever let anyone be uncomfortable in your house unless they’re family. When you set the places, give them all the right cutlery and make sure it’s polished. Make sure the table cloth is cleaned and ironed. They shouldn’t be able to tell that any of this has ever been eaten on before. The mark of a good southern home is that it looks like nobody lives there. You’ve got to impress, especially on Sundays, and damn sure if it’s the pastor coming. 

*I’m not even sure I want to go to church.* 

You better hope you remember how to iron your Sunday dress, because I don’t have time to do it for you.
