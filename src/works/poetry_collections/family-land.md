## Ode to the Windchimes

How long have you hung there, watching <br>
from the rafters of this place as tragedy <br> 
after tragedy marrs these red brick walls? <br>
What have you seen? What do you remember? 

<p align="right">
    I remember the sight of you when you were <br>
    just a little, barefoot boy. I’m sorry I don’t hold <br>
    the secret to that time of simplicity, the knowledge <br>
    of how to get back to the time when we felt whole. 
</p>

Do you remember the day I stopped <br>
being that little boy? Did you watch <br>
as my shoulders broadened and my <br>
face settled in behind its mask? 

<p align="right">
    I remember the day that this house saw the last  <br>
    smile you would ever give it. I hear it creak, <br>
    an aching moan at the thought that you will leave <br>
    having never shown joy to the hills again. 
</p>

Do you still feel the love I have <br>
for you that I don’t know how to give? <br>
Do you see it in my eyes, when I sit <br>
on this porch and watch you sway in the wind? 

<p align="right">
    I have learned to bend to any breeze, I know <br>
    how to adapt to anything that may flow through me. <br>
    I am sorry you must learn to love me this way, <br>
    but I will never stop trying to be worthy of that love. 
</p>

## Ode to the Blossoming Magnolia

There is no sight in all of this land, not <br>
even beyond the boundary of the pines, <br>
that can outclass the view of white petals <br>
sprouting from waxy emerald embrace. 

The bud bursts into being, springing forth <br>
from the pastoral place of possibility; in <br>
its youthful beauty, it loosens its petals, tentatively <br>
graces the world with its scent, trickling <br>
ever so slightly into the humid, darkening air. 

It opens, finally, under the dawning light <br>
of a new solstice sun, morning dew resting <br>
on freshly opened petals that are softer than <br>
the fingertips of the angels that delivered <br>
Moses’s manna, its core the color of the sun <br>
in the height of day, shining just as brightly. 

It remains, a beacon of botanical beauty <br>
while the sun rises and falls for a fortnight and <br>
then, even the magnificent magnolia blossom must <br>
wither away; even boundless beauty is not immune <br>
to the sinful passage of time. The blossom browns, <br>
age wrinkling the edges of angelic petals and creeping <br>
closer and closer to the center until finally 

The magnolia blossom falls from its tree. 

## Ode to the Wandering of Forest Paths

I have never met a soul, even among those<br>
who share the same blood, that understood <br>
what it meant to me to get lost among <br>
the trunks of those evergreens. 

<p align="center">
They see it as aimless wandering, a <br>
pointless exercise in insignificance;<br>
simply an attempt to pass the time. <br>
I’ve never seen them be more wrong. 

<p align="right">
There, underneath the loving embrace <br>
of an all-knowing canopy of pines, oaks, <br>
and elms, I am, at last, at peace. There, <br>
listening to the stories these sisters have seen

<p align="center">
I can finally feel as if I am not alone. So, <br>
I walk the pathways, leaving my shoes outside <br>
the door to the house I’ll soon forget about, my <br>
soles fusing my soul to the dark, cool earth of home. 

And as I lose myself in the finding of new places<br>
to walk, I realize that all can be lost, left behind<br>
like my shoes at the door, never to venture <br>
beyond the treeline, and it brings me hope. 

<p align="center">
If all can be lost outside, surely <br>
all can be found within.
