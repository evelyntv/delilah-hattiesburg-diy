# Necrology

Was being struck by lightning not enough to earn your love? <br>
I am made of parts of you – discarded yes but handpicked<br>
pieces stitched together in your graven image am I an idol<br>
unworthy of worship or is the reflection of your own face<br>
something you are still simply incapable of loving?

You taught me right from wrong yet wronged me for doing right<br>
by your rules; am I not to do as my creator did? Is following <br>
in your footsteps the wrong step to take or is my living shadow<br>
too real a reminder of all the missteps that brought you<br>
to the point of creation instead of healing? Is my life<br>
your last hail-mary to avoid admitting you lived yours?

The fire of your mistakes terrifies me – the glint<br>
of our relation flickers like your fingerprints threatening<br>
to burn away what little stitches hold me together<br>
your handiwork is the last piece of you I have left the only<br>
act of love you deemed small enough to leave me with

Can you blame me for being afraid? Am I wrong to fear<br>
being consumed the way that you were or is being burned<br>
simply too final a nail in the coffin of becoming you?<br>
Am I wrong for destroying my creator or is my creator wrong <br>
for trying to breathe life from a mouth that stinks<br>
of death? Did I kill you because I am too much like you<br>
is it my fault that dead hands can only bring death if necrotic<br>
neuroticism is the only thing passed down from the man<br>
who passed up his chance at heaven when he made me?

What does a creation do in a world without its creator?<br>
How is the clay to learn how to be anything more <br>
than the imprint of the potter’s hand when it is left<br>
abandoned and doomed to dry? Is the kiln the only choice<br>
or would solidifying the image of the man who made me<br>
be the final footstep to becoming his monster?

No answer comes in lessons learned <br>
silence is so loud when killing the man<br>
who gave you life is the only way<br>
you can live. <br>

# Lycanthropy

The first full moon came on my 16th birthday – clandestine <br>
Fates have a cruel sense of humor like it's funny <br>
to them; the would-be-witch unaware of the were<br>
coursing through bones that are ready to be broken<br>
by the violence of a creature lurking under the skin<br>
of a girl who barely knew how to do her eyeliner <br>
there were no snapping jaws or ragged claws and bloodlust<br>
is the hallmark of broken-in womanhood – the hair<br>
the hair was the first sign<br>

It sprouted from everywhere it wasn’t supposed to,  creeping<br>
like kudzu down legs that can’t run fast enough – a coat of maggots<br>
infesting the corpse of the girl that never got to be – a razor<br>
is no substitute for a scalpel but self-efficacy quickly transforms<br>
to self-harm; aesthetic modification isn’t as permanent as an autopsy<br>
what is alive will grow back even if it wishes it was dead<br>
and hair is no exception

There’s nothing exceptional about living in fear of full moons<br>
lunacy descending with the ascension of every lunar cycle<br>
bones bend at all the wrong angles hip bones sharp and jutting<br>
godless reminders gnashing like teeth snarling the message<br>
that this girl is not as she’s intended to be – a temple<br>
to the most unholy of ghosts: the bastardization <br>
of the divine feminine

You want to be a woman? Crack your bones back into place<br>
rip the hair from your flesh and blush your cheeks with the blood<br>
performing humanity is a performance all the same and you are far<br>
from the only grotesque creature in these woods – Howl<br>
and they’ll keep you company until the sun returns – no one else<br>
will hear; men never listen to anything less beastly than themselves<br>
even you could never best the beast of all beasts

There is no goddess to beseech for freedom from this – Artemis<br>
wouldn’t taint an arrow with the blood of one so unsightly<br>
your misery is unworthy of being put out of and you’re out<br>
of concealer so what’s the point? Dry the tears and put a muzzle on it<br>
no one wants to hear the girl who cried wolf especially when she’s crying<br>
about her own damn reflection – don’t you know what they do<br>
to girls like you who slip up and let themselves <br>
be seen?<br>

# Vampirism

Love is something that burns in the sunlight when you <br>
are a creature that’s only accepted by night / rendezvous <br>
with strangers you drink from like taps to satiate the thirst<br>
for more; a hollow substitute for the life you lost by being<br>
/ what / you are

Reflections are a luxury bestowed only to those who can walk<br>
in the light of day / those who do not sleep in coffins / those<br>
who are not undead reminders of who they were before they / changed /<br>
prayers don’t work like garlic and no one will invite you in anywhere<br>
that will feel like home / homes are for those who can bring someone<br>
in them without worrying if they’ll be invited back through the door

A stake through the heart will kill anyone but the stakes<br>
aren’t as high for people whose hearts are still beating / the heartless<br>
are not deserving of love they are condemned, damnation<br>
is the only fate befitting someone who turned their back on humanity<br>
and surely you did because no one considered human is afraid<br>
of being seen in the daylight

You shouldn’t have to ingest someone to keep a part of them with you<br>
what else can you do when the world takes up pitchforks and torches<br>
to keep everyone you could love out of your reach? How dark it is<br>
to have to drag someone into the darkness just to hold them / forever /<br>
doesn’t have quite the same ring to it when you know they’re only staying<br>
with you because no one else will take them with your mark on their neck

Fire isn’t all that burns / shame / is all-consuming as any flame<br>
when it’s put to the flashpaper skin of an alabaster outlier / your skin<br>
betrays you for what you are and no cloak can cover you from the gaze<br>
of those who / know / what you / are / what you / do / how you / thirst / for warmth<br>
would do anything to pull it from the people around you those full of life<br>
you can’t remember what it feels like to live / is that why<br>
you look at people like they’re something to eat? 


Everything must eat to survive but the hypocrisy of the predator <br>
means nothing in the face of the allegation of parasitism <br>
they will never see you, only who you put your lips to / so drink<br>
all things deserve to live.
