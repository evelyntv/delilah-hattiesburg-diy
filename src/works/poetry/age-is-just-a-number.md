I'm high in a bed with someone else's sex sheets\
and my best friend just told me he was with\
a seventeen-year-old and I can see the names\
of every man that told me age was just a number\
when mine wasn't even enough to let me drive. 

At seventeen a girl can't have a word in who\
leads her country but she can hear the lines\
from thirty year old men who think having her\
will make them feel like more of a man, John Mayer\
inspired a whole album from Taylor Swift, how many\
poems do I have to write until I can forget \
the opinions of grown men on my growing body?

Boots straps and elbow grease are no good when girlhood\
is leaking out of the cracks in my heart and I'm trying\
to live something other than a Leanna Firestone song\
for once and coming up empty handed and hollowâ€”

I went to bed with him because I thought he was safe\
and he went to bed with her because he thought she \
was mature for her age and here I am in the same sheets\
trying to sleep and seeing Omegle messages behind my lids. 

Did I not do enough time? If age is just a number why\
isn't it worth enough to buy the wisdom of forgiving\
my thirteen-year-old self for looking for love\
on all the wrong websites?

When will I finally be able to grow past never growing up\
and let myself grow into someone who won't want to be picked\
by men that pluck the youngest flower they can find?

Soon my number will be just enough to buy me a drink\
maybe then I'll be able to learn the difference between\
the wolf and sheep's clothing and make my way out \
of the pasture where I pretend to be the two-headed calf;

Stars can only be enough to look up to for so long\
but at least now I don't look up at men who look down\
on the youth they salivated over; that has to count for something

Or I'll always be just a number.
