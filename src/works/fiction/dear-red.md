Dear Red, 

I swore to myself I would never write this letter. I told myself, we both did, I suppose, that when we said goodbye that would be that. We’d leave the last of us at that bus station and move on with our lives with nothing more than the little pieces of each other that live in our hearts. Or, in my case, the empty chamber where my heart should be. I should have known better than to believe when I made that promise to myself. 

I know I’ll never be able to send this. I’d never let myself, and even if I did, I’d have no way to get it to you. We made sure of that, didn’t we? One last kiss and a goodbye present wrapped in pieces of our souls, but we never let an address slip. If I got really desperate, I could call home, ask your folks how to reach you. I don’t think that would be so hard to believe– we were friends, they knew that. I don’t think I’ll ever get that desperate. I don’t think you’d take too well to what I’m going to say in this letter. 

I’ll never be able to let you go, Red. Even now, halfway through Idaho with a bus full of strangers running from their pasts at my side, it’s taking everything in me not to repeat your name. Your real name. I’m full of too much fear to even think of writing it down, but I still catch myself whispering it under my breath when no one is listening. Under the drone of the tires against the pavement, the squeal of the brakes at a traffic light, the sound of the Beatles from someone’s Walkman two seats down– I’m shaping my every breath around your name and hoping the feel of it stays on my lips forever. If I’m honest with myself, I’m writing this to have a piece of you outside of me. So, someday, when my mind is gone and my body isn’t far behind, I’ll be able to pull this envelope out of a dusty cabinet and blow my gray hair out of my face and read about you. 

I don’t dare to imagine it, but I hope it’s just like falling in love with you all over again. 

I’m quite certain I’ll never love anyone the way I loved you. And not in the ‘young, dumb first-love’ way, but in the way that a widow is sure as she watches her love lowered in the ground. You took a piece of me with you today, Red. I’ll never get it back, and I don’t want it. The thought that you have a part of me with you is more comfort than that piece could ever be to me. Keep that piece of me, Red. It will always belong to you, no matter where my life takes me. That heart that you have in your hand, it will always have your name on it. This portion of my life, it’s always going to be yours, and that thought is almost enough to get me through this bus ride. 

I keep trying to think of what you’re thinking of. If I know you as well as I think I do, you’re thinking about me thinking about you. And your head is hurting from all the thinking. So, I want you to think of other things. I want you to remember, because remembering hurts your heart and not your head, and because I’m holding your heart, so if it hurts, I know you’re okay, out there somewhere. I’ll try not to grip your heart too tight, Red. 

Do you remember our booth at the diner? All those weeknights feel like another lifetime now, huh? At least they do to me. I still remember your order, though. The House Burger, no tomatoes, no mustard, extra pickles with fries with as much salt as they’ve got and a large vanilla shake. Every time like clockwork. The waitress didn’t even take your order anymore by the time you left. She just sat you and put in for the burger. You laughed and she smiled even when she tried not to and she scribbled hearts on your receipt. You thought the green spark in my eye was the best entertainment in the world. You’d be sure to flash me her notes just to see it. Then you’d hold my hand under the table to appease me. Your smirk would always turn into a smile when I squeezed your hand. 

Then you’d pay and we’d pack up our stuff and pile into your old Chevy and make our way to some hangout. I still remember the sadness in your face when you had to sell that truck. I know how much it meant to you, that last piece of your mom’s handiwork. You used to tell me about her working on it all the time, the sight of her wiping grease off her cheek with a smile. I swear, I could have counted her laugh lines from the memories swimming in your eyes. Or maybe she just left them on your face.

I want you to know that you still have the memories you made in that truck. The map of every winding back road in Maple County isn’t just in your head, Red. It’s on your heart, right next to the last hug she gave you. You’ve still got her memory, even if you don’t have the truck. 

You remember our favorite hangout spot? I think I’ll be seeing that old abandoned drive-in in my dreams for the rest of my life. It was Georgia Mayweather that showed it to you, on your first date when you were sixteen. I try not to think about what else you may have done. It was usually pretty easy. You were hard to look away from when we were there. You came to life the second we pulled in. I never could figure out what it was about that place that brought the spark back to life in you, but I guess it wasn’t for me to know. It was for me to sit in your passenger seat and listen to old seventies music and marvel at your laugh. It was for me to kiss you under the moonlight that leaked in through your windshield. It was for me to memorize the feel of you. 

I still can’t believe you got the projector to work that last night. The place must have been closed since they opened the new theater in the mall in ‘81, but you got the projector to play like it was open yesterday. Our last night together, spent watching the Shining in the cab of your truck. I still remember every time you jumped. You hid in my shoulder and I swear, in that moment, I could define ‘love’ down to the letter. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to watch that movie again. 

I don’t even think I’ll be able to get off this bus. I know it sounds stupid, but somehow, if I don’t get off this bus, it’s not real. So long as we don’t run out of barren Midwest roads, I don’t have to admit that I’ll never see you again. I think it might kill me when I do admit it. I’ll never see you again, Red. I’ll be writing around these tears for the rest of my life, I swear it. I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to you, Red. I wasn’t, I’m not, I won’t ever be. This goodbye will be the death of me. It will. I’m still not ready, a couple hundred miles and a handful of lifetimes later, I’m still not ready. 

But I’m running out of paper and we’re pulling into Washington now, so I guess I’ll have to be ready. I have a feeling I’ll be good at that soon, being ready when I’m not ready. I hope you don’t mind if I draw a little strength from your heart. It’s all I’ve got.

I’ll still try not to squeeze it too tight. And I’ll try to write when I can. Goodbye, Red. I love you.
