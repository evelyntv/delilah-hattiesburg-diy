The last time there was a blood moon this full, she was a very different person. Once-blonde ringlets that used to hang around a heart shaped face with a little too much blush for her own good had long since given way to auburn curls that framed cheekbones that were sharper than they used to be, even when they weren’t shadowed by the moonlight that leeched silver the pine needle blanket coating the forest beneath her feet. The wind whipped through them now, strands catching in the mascara of her feathery lashes. Her red lips murmured words in some long forgotten tongue as she shifted in the folds of white lace that draped from her arms and whispered over the glass bottles and the yellowed pages of the ancient leather book that laid at her feet on the floor of  the small clearing. The cauldron bubbled over the spitting flame in the ring of stones she’d so carefully laid out on the soft moss. The white circle of salt encompassed her like Saturn’s rings, broken only by the tips of the blacksalt pentacle she sat in the heart of. 

She pulled from her lap an ornate wooden box, opening it slowly to reveal a carved silver dagger. The handle was mother of pearl, and there were runes engraved along the gleaming blade that seemed to glow ever so faintly with the same red that painted her lips. Her teeth sunk into the bottom of one as she gazed at it, holding it up in a pale hand to watch the tinted moonlight bounce off the razor’s edge. Her fingers curved around the hilt of it, the tips of her slightly-too-long nails digging into her palm again. She’d just brought the blade to the palm of her hand, hovering over the cauldron when the wind shifted ever so slightly, whistling a low, peeling bell of a note through the boughs of her woodland sanctuary.

"Didn’t your momma ever teach you not to play with fire, baby bird?" The shadow purred somewhere to her left. 

"A witch like you is one to talk," The brunette girl responded, her eyes not moving from the blade pressing delicately into her alabaster palm.

"Even I would think twice before casting what you’re about to unleash, sweetheart," the other woman drawled as she stepped forward from the shadow of a tree closest to the circle above the right shoulder of the auburn-haired spellcaster. 

"You’ve never thought twice about anything," She said, peeking over her shoulder to meet the Nyx-dark eyes of the woman who seemed to appear from nowhere. 

"And with how much hell I’ve raised, that should be reason enough for you to pause, darlin’" she said. Even when reasoning, her voice was its usual purr. Seduction wrapped around the raven-haired woman tighter than the black gown that clung to every curve of her. She stepped forward, coming to rest just outside the circle she knew she couldn't enter, black ringlets of hair swinging forward to meet the shimmering air of the cast circle. 

"Are you sure about what you’re doing, Ophie?" she asked, raising a sculpted brow in genuine inquiry. 

"Ophelia," the young woman responded, the dagger shifting in her grip, almost breaking skin with its sharpness. "And I have to. He has to pay for what he’s done," she finished. Even under the canopy, even through the glassy cover of brimming tears, the moonlight was enough to see the green in her eyes harden. 

"There are other ways," she said, true pleading breaking through the lynx’s purr of her voice for the first time as she moved around the circle to stand in front of the woman who held the knife. Across the fire, she stood with her hands clasped in front of her, long, red nails stitched together like her knitted, furrowed brows. Her lips were poutier than usual, mauve creased with concern. 

"None that are enough. A sin like this demands blood, Soleil. You know that better than anyone," Ophelia said, looking up at her with practiced resolve. Her hands were steady, but her voice shook under the weight of her burdens. 

"That doesn’t mean it’s gotta be yours, hon," Soleil reasoned. The sentence seemed to jump out of her throat, as if it were escaping despite the clenching of her sharp jaw. She hadn’t meant to make that argument, but she seemed unable to stop herself. 

"Who else’s would hold enough sway to do what must be done?" Ophelia asked. Soleil didn’t answer, merely pressed her palm against the barrier between her and the auburn-haired woman in front of her. Against the humming, invisible air, the veins in her palm began to glow the same faint red as the sigils on the dagger. Ophelia gasped, a slight sound of shock easily swallowed by the wind. 

"You? You’d do this?" she asked, rising with grace beyond her years to stand face to face with the woman trying to talk her down from the dagger, only she still stood a good few inches shorter.

"Blood like yours is too good for the likes of him," Soleil said, drawing her hand back to hang by her side. Her eyes were so full of something even the smoke of the black shadow on her lids couldn’t hide. 

"So you’d spill your own?" Ophelia asked. Soleil didn’t answer again, merely held her hand up once more, this time extending it as if she were asking Ophelia for her own. 

"Let me in, Ophie," she asked. Ophelia hesitated, her own hands dropping. After a moment, she shook her head and raised her free hand. The air shimmered for a moment. Soleil stepped across the circle that had just barred her entry, and sank slowly to the forest floor, black velvet folds pooling around her crossed legs. Ophelia lowered once more to the ground, and the two girls stared at each other from across the fire, looking over the rolling bubbles of the cauldron. Soleil extended her hand, asking silently for the knife. Ophelia looked down at it, torn. 

"We’ll do it together," she said, holding the blade to her lace-covered chest and looking back up at the woman sitting across from her. Soleil recoiled slightly, her eyes widening. 

"That would mean-" 

"I know what it would mean," Ophelia interrupted. "We’ll do it together," she said again, her voice full of more steel than it was before. Soleil looked at her, her eyes searching for any traces of doubt. The wind blew through the clearing again, carrying away with it the last of the hesitation that had hung in the air. Soleil nodded, never taking her eyes off Ophelia’s face. The two of them bowed their heads as one, their faces made into moon-painted porcelain masks of concentration. They raised their hands, palms mirroring each other, save for Ophelia’s left hand, which still held the dagger. The book at her feet began to float, rising slowly to sit between both of the girls, pages fluttering of their own accord in the still air until they came to a stop on a stained page written in red ink. It was a language that seemed to shift, as if the words were desperate to not be read. Both women opened their mouths, reciting in unison, and the words stilled, burning into the page one by one as they were spoken. 

The wind began to roar, tearing through the needles of the towering pines and whipping their hair into frenzies, but doing nothing to turn the pages. The girls continued to chant, rhythmic streams of words pouring out through a purring timbre in an eloquent torrent. The fire underneath the cauldron turned a vivid scarlet, and the earth began to shake, the clinking of glass jars added to the cacophony of casting. The brew in the cauldron began to roll violently, glowing like red-hot metal, as if it should be hissing. The two women looked across at each other, coming to the end of their incantation. Soleil nodded, and Ophelia mirrored her, extending her hands over the cauldron, dagger poised over her open palm. 

Uttering a final word, she tipped her head back and slashed in one sweeping motion, blood pouring from the open slit in her palm. It fell into the brew below, a cascade of crimson. Her eyes rolled back, her mouth parting as she felt all the agony she’d been holding in her hollow chest flow out through her hand. She poured everything she had, and for a moment the feeling felt endless. The cup from which she emptied her pain seemed bottomless. Then, after what felt like an eternity, there was the faintest feeling of loss, like her blood had gone cold as the last drops of it left her and sailed through the open air towards the rolling surface of the ebony liquid below. She tilted her head back up, her eyes opening to meet Soleil’s gaze. There was something in her eyes, a strange mingling of profound sadness and resigned pride. Ophelia had finally left the side of love and light. She closed her bleeding hand, withdrawing it from over the cauldron and extending her other to pass Soleil the dagger. She took it, and after a moment of pause to look at her a bit longer, held it out over her own upturned palm, bloody side down. 

She slashed, and the same transfixed look came over her face as the blood flowed. Only this time, Ophelia could see, there was no release for her. Soleil’s blood seemed to flow as black as the dark brew beneath her hand, an endless stream of hatred. Her painted lip curled, anger betraying her as she squeezed her hand, too impatient for the blood to flow naturally. The quietest, most guttural grunt left her, and Ophelia realized she was not the only one who had been carrying the pain of what had happened to her all these weeks. There was a reason Soleil knew she would be here on the night of the blood moon, and Ophelia thought she knew now what it was. 

Soleil brought her head back upright, pulling back her hand and lowering the dagger, cleaning it off with the bowl of moonwater on her side of the fire. She extended her unslashed hand and the box flew to her. She placed the dagger back in its pillowed hollow and closed the box. The wind stilled, and the book closed, thudding to the ground. The two women looked up at each other, each of their chests heaving with the effort and reality of what they had just done. Ophelia felt for the first time the magnitude of the choice she’d just made.

Soleil stood, making her way around the now dying fire to kneel again in front of Ophelia. She took her cut hand, holding it in her own, two wounds overlapping. With the other hand, she waved a sweeping motion over their joined hands and let a single tear fall. They both clenched as the heat of the magic swept over their open wounds, and a moment later when they flattened their palms out, they were as smooth as they’d been before the ritual began. Ophelia looked up from her healed hand and found Soleil already gazing at her. Her eyes were bottomless pools of something Ophelia couldn’t quite put a name to. Her mascara hadn’t run; always waterproof. 

"There’s one more piece of the ritual. You can still change your mind. You can turn back, baby bird," she murmured. Her hand came up to rest against Ophelia’s cheek. She leaned into it, just for a brief moment. In that instant, she considered. Hesitated. Imagined the two roads that lay before her. Under Soleil’s touch, she could almost see her life if she healed, could almost believe that this feeling could heal her better than Soleil’s magic, or any magic could. But then her chest hitched as she remembered what wound it was she had to heal, and her jaw clenched as her resolve returned. 

"He can’t just get away with what he’s done," she said, opening her eyes to meet Soleil’s gaze. It was defeated, but not disappointed. Surprise was nowhere to be found in her eyes. 

"Then let’s finish this," she said quietly, standing to offer Ophelia her hand. Ophelia took it, standing and walking around her to pick the cauldron up. The fire had died while they healed, and the iron of it was cool to the touch. She turned, holding it between herself and Soleil. What they now had to do was something she hadn’t thought of when she’d invited Soleil to cast this with her. Her stomach turned at what came next. Soleil may as well have seen it; she knew exactly what Ophelia was thinking. 

"It’s me, Ophelia. I could never hurt you, baby bird, you know that," she murmured. Ophelia blinked, and for the first time since that night felt butterflies she thought were long dead in her stomach. She held out the cauldron before she could think. Soleil looked at her, dipping the tips of her fingers into the inky magic within. Slow as a blooming magnolia, she reached out and slid the sleeves of Ophelia’s white dress off her shoulders. It fell to the forest floor, and Soleil’s eyes never left hers.

Without looking away, Soleil reached down and drew another sigil, something not unlike that of the symbol for infinity, directly over Ophelia’s thundering heart. Her touch was softer than the whisper of the wind in the top of the pines. For the first time since she could remember, Ophelia didn’t shiver when someone touched her. When she was done, Soleil drew her hand back and took the cauldron from Ophelia’s grasp. Ophelia reached into it, dipping the tips of two fingers on her right hand inside. The magic in it was hot, like it was just their spilt blood inside and not the concoction of other ingredients she’d added before Soleil stepped out of the shadows. 

She reached her other hand up and undid the ribbon holding Soleil’s dress to her chest. It drifted down to the ground in a pile with hers, black and white overlapping. Ophelia didn’t look away from Soleil now as she drew an identical sigil over her heart. When she was done, the two stared at each other for a single, silent piece of forever. 

"Are you ready?" Soleil asked. She raised the cauldron above their heads, and the sigils on their chest seemed to hum as the last act of the ritual came almost into being. Ophelia nodded. Soleil tipped the cauldron.

The magic poured out, washing over them in an inky red haze. It felt as if they were standing under a waterfall that was pouring heaven and hell from the same tap. Everything the two of them had felt over the man they’d just spilled their blood over coursed through every vein in them, and they both nearly crumpled under the weight of it. Ophelia's heart skipped one single beat, and then it was over. The cauldron was empty, and they were both coated in blood and magic. They looked at each other, silent, grasping for the first time what they’d done. 

Before Ophelia could speak, Soleil reached out and grabbed her hand, turning, and in a single breath, they were miles away standing next to the lake they’d grown up with. Soleil held her hand, leading her down the shore and into the water. When they were up to nearly their shoulders, she turned, letting go of Ophelia’s hand to hold her face and gently lower her into the water. 

There, under the moonlight, Soleil washed the blood and magic off her skin, rubbing away with the gentlest of touches all the pain and every trace of stain on her skin. The water lapped around them in a soft song, and the touch of Soleil’s hand washed over her in a cleaner feeling than even this crystal lake could provide. For a moment, Ophelia closed her eyes and met peace like an old friend. 

When it was done, and she was clean, she stood again and reached out to Soleil. Lowering her down, Ophelia began to wash her clean the same way. Soleil never closed her eyes, looking up at Ophelia with that same endlessness pooling in her irises. Ophelia looked back, for once not worrying about what her eyes showed. In a moment like this, there were no secrets to be had. 

As they were both washed clean, they embraced, laying their heads on each other’s shoulders and breathing together. The water stilled around them, the two standing there as if made of stone. Neither of them wanted to leave, but eventually Ophelia shivered as the breeze rippled over them, and Soleil raised her head. Cupping her cheek again, she turned them once more and they were standing in Soleil’s room. Ophelia looked around, gazing at the bookshelves and candles and ivy-colored walls she hadn’t seen in so long. She felt peace settle into the hollow in her chest again, and realized just how long it had been since she’d truly breathed as she inhaled deeply the scent of roses and home. 

When she turned back around, Soleil was already wrapping her in a soft, white towel. She dragged the cotton across Ophelia’s skin, drying every inch of her with care. She took her time, never moving too quickly or pressing too hard, and she never spent too long in any one place. When she was done, she dried herself as well, and took Ophelia gently by the hand and led her over to the bed. It was never made, so she pulled the blankets back and tucked Ophelia into the warmth of them, laying down beside her. Ophelia inched closer, laying her head on Soleil’s chest. Her breath stopped for a moment, and then she wrapped her arms around Ophelia’s shoulders. They laid there for a while, just breathing.

"What do you think will happen when they find him?" Ophelia asked a moment later, speaking to the dancing flame of a candle on the antique chest across the room. 

"Nothing I can’t get you out of," Soleil responded, and Ophelia believed her. When the sun rose in a few hours, it would all be finished. It was truly over. Ophelia allowed the breath she’d been holding all these nights finally leave her in one gust, and she felt sleep run it’s finger up the back of her skull in the greeting it only gave those it hadn’t seen in far too long. She sighed, sinking deeper into Soleil’s embrace. 

"Soleil," she said, mumbling through the last of her alertness. 

"Yeah?" Soleil responded. 

"Thank you for being there with me," Ophelia said, already drifting off. 

"Always," Soleil said, the last thing Ophelia heard.
